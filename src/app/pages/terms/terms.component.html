The Service and the content on the Service, such as text, graphics, source code, images, videos, photographs, illustrations, trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, information obtained from Experiences licensors, and other materials (the “Contents”) is protected by intellectual property rights under both United States and foreign laws.  Ownership of the Contents - in other words, ownership of all intellectual property rights in such Contents - remains with Experiences or our licensors and/or partners, including without limitation WME IMG, LLC and IMG Worldwide, LLC.  All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Experiences and its licensors.  If you violate any of these Terms of Use, your permission to use the Contents automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Contents.
Any use of the Contents not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.
Except as otherwise stated herein, you may not, without Experiences’s written permission, “mirror” any Contents contained in the Service or any other server and you agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, distribute, post, transmit, or exploit for any commercial purpose, any portion of the Service or the Contents other than as expressly authorized by Experiences in writing.  You may not use the Service for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use, including to defame, harass, stalk, threaten, abuse, or otherwise violate the rights of a third party as defined by applicable law.
Whilst you are in compliance with these terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal, revocable limited license to access and/or use the Service (but not any related object and source code) for your own personal private use, in each case provided that such use is in accordance with these Terms of Use.  You agree not to use the Service for anything else.  These Terms of Use also apply to any update or patches which we may release or make available for the Service and any such update or patch shall be deemed part of the Service for the purposes of these Terms of Use.
You agree that you will not remove or modify any acknowledgements, credits, or legal notices contained on the Service or in the Contents.  Where applicable, you shall include the following copyright notice: “Copyright © 2019, Endeavor Experiences.  All rights reserved.”
Any special rules for the use of other items provided on the Service may be included elsewhere within the Service and are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.  The use of the Contents on any other site or in a networked computer environment for any purpose is prohibited.
You may not use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Service.  You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service through hacking, password mining, or any other means.
You may not reverse engineer any aspect of the Service or do anything which might discover source code or bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to any part of the Service.

Experiences reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Service, or any portion thereof, at any time, if there is a justifiable reason, without prior notice or any notice.
If, for any reason, you create any derivatives, modifications, or improvements to the Contents and/or Service ("Derivatives"), all right, title and interest (including existing and future intellectual property rights) in such Derivatives ("Derivative Rights") vest in Experiences immediately upon creation.  You hereby assign to Experiences with full title guarantee all right, title, and interest in all such Derivative Rights.
