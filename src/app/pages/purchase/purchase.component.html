<div class="underline bold">CURRENCY</div>

<p>All prices for experience packages are stated in U.S. Dollars. </p>

<div class="underline bold">PAYMENT METHODS</div>

<p>If you wish to reserve an experience package through the Site, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the transaction, including, without limitation, payment information.  We accept several methods of payment to accommodate your needs, including most major credit cards.  You represent and warrant that any credit card information that you submit to us is true, accurate and complete, and you agree to immediately notify us if any information is inaccurate.  You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment methods used in connection with a transaction.</p>

<p>When you book an experience package using a credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card at the time you make the reservation.  You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your credit card by the card issuer, bank or financial institution, including, without limitation any credit card membership, overdraft or over-the-credit-limit fees.  Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions.  If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a U.S. credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. </p>

<div class="underline bold">PACKAGES AND PRICING</div>

<p>Experience packages are subject to availability, on the dates and at the locations we determine in our discretion.  All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, and prices of experience packages described or depicted on the Site are subject to change at any time without notice, and we reserve the right to cancel or remove any experience package from the Site at any time in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>All packages include admission tickets at face value.  You shall be responsible for paying all taxes and third-party expenses, if applicable, imposed on or in connection with the experience packages, except for shipping costs related to ítems or documentation that we may, at our discretion, mail you in connection with your experience package purchase (unless otherwise stated in writing by us).</p>

<div class="underline bold">ERRORS</div>

<p>We make a conscientious effort to describe and display the experience packages accurately on the Site.  Despite these efforts, from time to time, a package may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable.  As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, experience descriptions, or availability.  We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.  If the amount charged to you for an experience package is incorrect, or if you are able to order an experience package before its scheduled on-sale or presale date, or if you are able to order an experience package that was not supposed to have been released for sale, then we will have the right to cancel that experience package (or your order for that experience package) and refund to you the full amount that you paid.  This will apply regardless of whether because of human error or a transactional malfunction of this Site or other platform.</p>

<div class="underline bold">ORDER CONFIRMATION</div>

<p>If you do not receive a confirmation (in the form of a confirmation page or email) after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm via our customer service whether or not your order has been received.  Only you may be aware of any problems that may occur during the purchase process.  We will not be responsible for losses (monetary or otherwise) if you assume that an order was placed if you failed to receive confirmation.  We do not guarantee availability of services or any elements of an experience package until there is confirmation that payment has been received and an order has been processed by the Site.</p>

<div class="underline bold">BILLING INFORMATION VERIFICATION</div>

<p>Orders are subject to credit card approval and will be processed only after a billing address and other billing information has been verified.  Occasionally, we receive incorrect billing or credit card account information for an order, which may delay processing and delivery.  In these cases, our customer service will attempt to contact you, using the information provided at the time of purchase.  If we are unable to reach you, we may cancel your order and may sell your experience package to another customer without further notice.</p>

<div class="underline bold">NUMBER OF EXPERIENCES PACKAGES OR LIMITS</div>

<p>When purchasing experiences packages, you may be limited to a specified number of packages for each event (also known as a “package limit”).  This package limit is explained during the purchase process and is verified prior to every transaction.  We reserve the right, in our discretion, to cancel any or all orders and package purchases without prior notice to you if you exceed the posted limits.  This includes orders associated with the same name, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number or other information.</p>

<div class="underline bold">FULL PAYMENT REQUIRED</div>

<p>Full payment is upon checkout to secure your experience package.  We are not obligated to provide an experience package, or any elements of an experience package, unless and until we receive the full and timely payment for such experience package.  If we do not receive payment a reasonable time before the event to which the experience package relates, we have the right to cancel your order and terminate the fulfillment of the package without any further obligation or liability owed to you. </p>

<div class="underline bold">DELIVERY</div>

<p>You acknowledge that the items and components of an experience package will generally be provided and/or fulfilled by Experiences on-site on or around the day(s) of an event.  We will make all on-site arrangements related to the fulfillment of an experience package on your behalf (excluding transportation, unless we expressly tell you otherwise). </p>

<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated by Experiences, any tickets or credentials required as part of an experiences package will not be mailed to you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Experiences may, at its discretion, mail or deliver to you certain ítems (e.g., gifts or welcome materials) or documents (itineraries) ancillary to or related to your experience package.  Any stated delivery dates with respect thereto are approximate.  Experiences will not be liable for any losses, damages, penalties, or expenses that arise from or in connection with the ítems or documents during shipment or the failure to meet any delivery date.  Title to and risk of loss of any items and documents we mail or deliver to you will pass to you immediately upon delivery to the carrier by us.</p>

<div class="underline bold">CANCELED AND RESCHEDULED EVENTS</div>

<p>Should the entire event to which your experience package(s) relate be canceled or rescheduled, we will attempt to contact you to inform you of the refund or exchange procedures for that event.  For exact instructions on any canceled or rescheduled event, please contact us in the manner set forth above.</p>

<p>If the entire event for which your experience package relates is canceled, and you purchased your experience package through the Site (or otherwise directly from us), we will issue you a refund to the credit card, debit card, or other accepted method of payment that you used to purchase that experiences package.  IF A PACKAGE WAS PURCHASED THROUGH ANOTHER METHOD, PLEASE CONTACT THE PERSON OR ENTITY FROM WHOM YOU PURCHASED SUCH PACKAGE, AS WE WILL NOT REFUND YOU THEREFOR.</p>

<p>Tickets and experiences packages are sold subject to our absolute right to alter or vary the experiences without any obligation to make a refund.  However, if the experience, or any part of the experience, is materially altered from the pre-planned experience package, we may make reasonable efforts to provide a suitable alternative experience and, where that is not possible, we will issue you a refund to the credit card, debit card, or other accepted method of payment that you used to purchase that experiences package.  Please <a href="mailto:experiences@endeavorco.com">contact us</a> for more information regarding our refund policy in those situations.  When contacting us with respect to the foregoing, please make sure to include/provide appropriate identification (e.g., purchase confirmation number) so we can expedite our handling of your inquiry.</p>

<p>If we issue you a refund for an experience package due to a canceled or rescheduled event, we will issue a refund of face value paid for the ticket (if any) (or, for a discounted ticket, the discounted ticket price paid), all ticket service fees (if any), and the portion of the experience where we were not able to provide an alternative experience (if any), as applicable.  In no event will delivery charges or any other amounts be refunded.  If a refund is issued, where reasonably possible it will be issued using the same method of payment that was used to purchase the experience package.  We will not be liable for travel or any other expenses that you or anyone else incurs in connection with a canceled or rescheduled event.</p>

<div class="underline bold">RETURNS & REFUNDS</div>

<p>All sales are final.  Payments are non-refundable and cannot be canceled by you, except to the limited extent contemplated above in the “Canceled and Rescheduled Events” section.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard to experience packages you purchased.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not contact us to seek a refund or exchange from us except in the limited circumstances set forth above, and you will not dispute or otherwise seek a “chargeback” from the company whose credit card you used to purchase experience packages from the Site.  Should you do so, your experience package(s) may be canceled, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future experience packages purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist and any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the Site.</p>

<div class="underline bold">ASSUMPTION OF RISK</div>

<p>BY PURCHASING OR REDEEMING AN EXPERIENCE PACKAGE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS NATURE AND RISK IN THE EVENT(S) TO WHICH THE PACKAGE RELATES, AND YOU ACCEPT ALL SUCH RISKS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR DEATH.

YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL RISKS AND DANGER INCIDENTAL TO THE EVENT(S) TO WHICH THE PACKAGE RELATES, WHETHER OCCURRING BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE EVENT(S).</p>

<div class="underline bold">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</div>

<p>YOU WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH AGAINST EXPERIENCES AND ALL OF OUR RESPECTIVE PARENTS, AFFILIATED ENTITIES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, OWNERS, PERSONNEL, AND EMPLOYEES, AND THE VENUES, MODELS, DESIGNERS, SPONSORS, ARTISTS, AND OTHER ATTENDEES, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND ANY ACCOMPANYING MINOR.  YOU BEAR ALL RISKS OF INCLEMENT WEATHER.  EVENT DATES AND TIMES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL IN NO WAY LIMIT OR REDUCE THE EFFECT OF THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF USE.  EXPERIENCES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PURCHASE POLICY OR THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER FORM OF ACTION) AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER YOU OR EXPERIENCES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE.  IN NO EVENT WILL EXPERIENCES’S LIABILITY EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID TO EXPERIENCES FOR THE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES PACKAGE PROVIDED BY EXPERIENCES GIVING RISE TO AN APPLICABLE CLAIM (DEFINED BELOW).  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; AS A RESULT, THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY TO A RESIDENT OF NEW JERSEY TO THE EXTENT DAMAGES TO SUCH NEW JERSEY RESIDENT ARE THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCES’S NEGLIGENT OR RECKLESS ACTS.</p>

<div class="underline bold">LIMITATION OF ACTIONS </div>

<p>No action arising out of or relating to this Purchase Policy or the transactions it contemplates may be commenced against Experiences more than 12 months after the basis for such claim could reasonably have been discovered.</p>

<div class="underline bold">INDEMNIFICATION</div>

<p>You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Experiences from and against any and all Claims (as defined below) that may be asserted by a third party against Experiences that arise out of, result from, or relate to your purchase of an experience package, enjoyment of any of the rights, benefits, or ítems related thereto, including, without limitation, attendance at the Event to which such experience package relates, and for all Claims that otherwise arise out of or result from, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, without limitation, your breach or failure to abide by any part of this Purchase Policy.</p>

<div class="underline bold">NO WARRANTIES</div>

<p>The experience packages are being sold “as is,” and Experiences disclaims all warranties of quality, whether express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose with respect thereto and the Site.  We make no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the Site, including without limitation any content available through the Site and any descriptions or depictions of experience packages.  You are responsable for verifying any information before relying on it.  Under no circumstances will Experiences be liable for the services or products of any third party, including any comprising or constituting a part of an experience package.  You acknowledge that you have not been induced by any statements or representations of any person with respect to the quality or condition of an experience package or any ítems constituting a part thereof and that no such statements or representations have been made.  You acknowledge that you have relied solely on the investigations, examinations, and inspections you, as a purchaser of the experience package, have chosen to make and that Experiences has afforded you the opportunity for full and complete investigations, examinations, and inspections.</p>

<div class="underline bold">LICENSE; EJECTION AND CANCELLATION; NO REDEMPTION VALUE</div>

<p>All event attendees shall comply with our and all of the event owners’, venues’, and operators’ (each, an “Event Provider”) applicable rules, policies, terms, and conditions (“Event Provider Rules”).  Event Providers reserve the right, without refund of any amount paid, to refuse admission to, or eject, any person whose conduct their personnel deems disorderly, who uses vulgar or abusive language, or who fails to comply with Event Provider Rules.  Breach of terms or rules will terminate your license to attend the event without refund.  Each experience package and/or the ticket, pass, or similar credential therefor or a part thereof is a revocable license and admission may be refused without liability in the case of a breach of any of the foregoing.  An experience package, and/or the tickets, passes, or similar credentials therefor or a part thereof, is not redeemable for cash.  Items listed in an experience package do not grant access to unauthorized areas of an event venue.</p>

<div class="underline bold">RECORDING, TRANSMISSION, AND EXHIBITION</div>

<p>You (on behalf of yourself and your guests) agree that the event for which you purchase an experience package is a public event, that your and their appearance and actions inside and outside the venue where the event occurs are public in nature, and that you and they have no expectation of privacy with regard to your or their actions or conduct at the event.  You (on behalf of yourself and your guests) grant permission to us and our licensees, partners, and agents to utilize your and/or their respective name, image, likeness, acts, poses, plays, appearance, movements, and statements in any live or recorded audio, video, or photographic display or other transmission, exhibition, publication, or reproduction made of, or at, the event (regardless of whether before, during, or after the event) for any purpose, in any manner, in any medium or context now known or hereafter developed, without further authorization from, or compensation to, you, them, or anyone acting on your and/or their behalf.</p>

<div class="underline bold">RECORDING AND DATA DISTRIBUTION PROHIBITED</div>

<p>Except as expressly authorized by Experiences or a third party authorized by Experiences, no event attendee may film, photograph, broadcast, stream, publish, transmit, and/or otherwise offer to the public (or assist any third party in offering to the public), on a live or on a delayed basis, in whole or in part, and whether on a free basis or subject to payment, any sound recording, photograph, video footage, motion picture, film, and/or other audio and/or visual content captured by any means whatsoever in or around the event site.</p>

<div class="underline bold">PUBLICITY</div>

<p>You agree that Experiences shall have the right to use your name, logo, marks, and other similar intellectual property for the purposes of publicizing the event, the experience packages, our services, and other reasonable commercial purposes, provided that such publicity efforts are in the normal course of our business (for example, without limitation, in business to business trade solicitation and communication).</p>

<div class="underline bold">YOU ARE SUBJECT TO SEARCH AND BACKGROUND CHECK</div>

<p>You, your guests, and your and their belongings may be searched on entry to the event.  You (on your behalf and their behalf) consent to such searches and waive any related claims that may arise.  If you and/or they elect not to consent to such searches, you and/or they may be denied entry to the event without refund or other compensation.  Under certain facility rules, certain items may not be brought into the premises, including without limitation, alcohol, drugs, controlled substances, cameras, recording devices, laser pointers, strobe lights, irritants (e.g., artificial noisemakers), bundles, and containers.</p>

<p>From time to time in relation to an event involving up-close interactions with celebrities, officials, or other VIPs, you and your guests may be subject to a criminal background check prior to such event.  You (on your behalf and their behalf) consent to such background checks and waive any related claims that may arise.  If you and/or your guests elect not to consent to such background checks, we may cancel your booking in our discretion.</p>

<div class="underline bold">MINORS</div>

<p>THE EVENT (OR ASPECTS THEREOF) MAY BE INTENDED FOR AN ADULT AUDIENCE.  EVENT ATTENDEES UNDER THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THE STATE, COUNTRY, OR JURISDICTION OF THEIR RESIDENCE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AT THE EVENT AT ALL TIMES.</p>

<div class="underline bold">REPRESENTATION</div>

<p>You represent and warrant to Experiences that you have the capacity and/or power and authority to agree to and enter into this Purchase Policy and, when agreed to by you, the Purchase Policy shall be enforceable against you and a legally binding obligation.</p>

<div class="underline bold">RESALE OR TRANSFER OF TICKETS</div>

<p>Unauthorized resale or transfer (or attempted resale or transfer), unlawful or otherwise, counterfeit or copy of experience packages and/or the tickets, passes, or similar credentials therefor or a part thereof is grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation.  Certain maximum resale premiums and restrictions may apply in some states or jurisdictions and we cannot be responsible for providing legal advice regarding resale or pricing of the foregoing.  You are responsible for complying with all applicable resale laws.  In addition, we reserve the right to restrict or deny purchasing privileges to anyone that we determine to be, or has been, in violation of our policies or in conflict with applicable law (e.g., entities or individuals on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or based in countries then subject to a U.S. sanction program).  Because we do not guarantee the authenticity of experience packages and/or the tickets, passes, or similar credentials therefor or a part thereof purchased from any non-authorized third party reseller (such as brokers or individuals), we recommend that you purchase experience packages directly through us or our authorized partners to ensure authenticity.  Experience packages and/or the tickets, passes, or similar credentials therefor or a part thereof may not be used for advertising, promotions, contests, or sweepstakes, unless formal written authorization is given by us.</p>

<div class="underline bold">BINDING ARBITRATION</div>

<p>You and Experiences agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or the experience packages shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you in your hometown area), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267.  The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures.  Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.  If you initiate arbitration against Experiences, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees.  If Experiences initiates arbitration against you, Experiences will be required to pay all costs associated with the arbitration.  If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein.  If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Experiences shall be entitled to arbitrate the dispute.  THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</p>

<p>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.  DO NOT PURCHASE OR REDEEM AN EXPERIENCE PACKAGE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.</p>
